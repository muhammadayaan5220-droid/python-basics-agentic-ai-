Welcome to **Python Basics for Agentic AI**, a comprehensive, beginner-friendly GitHub repository designed to teach you the fundamental Python skills necessary to succeed in modern Agentic AI and Large Language Model (LLM) application development.

We go from zero-to-hero on core concepts, focusing on the syntax and structures most relevant for data handling, control flow, and external tool interaction—all prerequisites for building intelligent agents.

## 💻 Running the Code

The primary method for running the code is **Google Colaboratory (Colab)**, which requires zero setup on your machine.

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Click on any `notebook.ipynb` file in the repository.
2.  **Run in Colab:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the file preview.
3.  **Execute Cells:** Click the play button next to each code cell or use `Shift + Enter`.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the Python files locally.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/python-basics-agentic-ai.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/python-basics-agentic-ai.git)
cd python-basics-agentic-ai/03_data_types_and_variables
python examples.py
