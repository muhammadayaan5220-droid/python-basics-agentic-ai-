## Style and Format Rules

1.  **Code Style:** All Python code must be **PEP 8 compliant**.
2.  **Notebooks (`.ipynb`):**
    * Notebooks must be **Google Colab-compatible** (no reliance on local paths or complex environment setups).
    * All cells must be executed and saved with their output before committing.
    * Use the provided auto-validation tests for exercises.
3.  **Markdown Files (`.md`):**
    * Use clear headers (`##`, `###`) and concise bullet lists.
    * Code blocks should be properly fenced and language-specified (e.g., \`\`\`python).
    * Keep the friendly, technical-but-accessible tone.
4.  **Flowcharts:** New or updated flowcharts should be placed in `/assets/images/` and should also be linked in the respective module's `README.md`.
